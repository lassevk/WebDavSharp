This project contains code to host a WebDAV server inside your own
software, and in the future, code to access a WebDAV server.

In order to run the unit-tests in this project you need the latest
version of [TypeMock Isolator][3]. Right now that is version 6.0.6.0.

If you don't have a license for [TypeMock Isolator][3], you can get
an open source license [here][4] that you can use.

Repository and project location: [CodePlex][1]  
Maintainer: [Lasse V. Karlsen][2]

**NOTE**: This code is still very, *very*, much in flux. Do not use this
in anything remotely related to production code. Expect methods to gain
new parameters, be overloaded, or to disappear completely.

**You have been warned!**
